# XtractForge — TODO

Status: `[ ]` todo · `[~]` wip · `[x]` done · `[!]` blocker

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit tests (plugin logic)
- [ ] Set up test runner — no test framework yet (add Vitest or Jest)
- [ ] `plugin-manager`: `getDownloaderForUrl` routes correct plugin per URL
- [ ] `plugin-manager`: disabled plugins are skipped in routing
- [ ] `plugin-manager`: yt-dlp always returned as fallback when all others disabled
- [ ] `plugin-manager`: `loadPluginFile` rejects invalid plugin (missing id/name/type)
- [ ] `plugin-manager`: `loadExternalPlugins` skips non-.js files, logs errors per file
- [ ] `plugin-manager`: `getPluginConfig` merges global + plugin-specific correctly
- [ ] Each plugin: `canHandle` returns true for its sites, false for unrelated URLs
- [ ] Each plugin: `parseProgress` extracts correct fields from sample output lines
- [ ] Each plugin: `configSchema` has no duplicate keys

### Integration tests (IPC)
- [ ] `check-dependencies` returns correct shape `{ [id]: { available, version, name, ... } }`
- [ ] `get-video-info` injects `pluginId` in response
- [ ] `set-plugin-enabled` persists to config.json correctly
- [ ] `save-plugin-configs` doesn't clobber unrelated plugin configs
- [ ] `import-plugin-file` returns `{ success: false }` for syntactically broken file
- [ ] `cancel-download` SIGTERM's correct process, not another download

### E2E / manual test checklist
- [ ] `pnpm dev` starts without errors (Vite + Electron both boot)
- [ ] URL analyze: YouTube → routes to yt-dlp
- [ ] URL analyze: Spotify → routes to spotdl
- [ ] URL analyze: Bilibili → routes to lux
- [ ] URL analyze: DeviantArt → routes to gallery-dl
- [ ] Download: yt-dlp video completes, file appears in folder
- [ ] Download: progress bar updates in real time
- [ ] Download: cancel kills process, item shows "Cancelled by user"
- [ ] Download: error (bad URL) surfaces in queue item
- [ ] Plugins tab: toggle disable yt-dlp → analyze any URL → still uses yt-dlp (it's hardcoded fallback — document this edge case)
- [ ] Plugins tab: import a valid .js plugin → appears in plugin list after import
- [ ] Plugins tab: import invalid .js → error shown, no crash
- [ ] Settings: save → reopen app → values persist (read from config.json)
- [ ] External plugin in `<userData>/plugins/` → auto-loads on next app start

---

## 🐛 Known Issues / Edge Cases

- [ ] yt-dlp can't truly be "disabled" since it's the hardcoded fallback in `getDownloaderForUrl` — decide: throw error or keep silent fallback
- [ ] `gallery-dl`: progress reporting is count-based (`#0042`), not percent — progress bar stays at 0% during download; UI should handle this case
- [ ] `spotdl`: `getInfo` returns a stub (no real metadata) because spotdl has no info-only mode — thumbnail always empty
- [ ] `startDownload` progress regex on stderr — lux writes progress to stderr, stdout is JSON; verify both streams are parsed
- [ ] `App.jsx`: `disabledPlugins` state initialized to `[]` but never loaded from config on mount — toggle state resets on reload
- [ ] Window width (1200px) added but `electron-builder` `build.files` doesn't include `electron/plugin-manager.js` — verify packaged build resolves module

## ✨ Features

### Plugin system
- [ ] Plugin marketplace / registry — browse a JSON index of community plugins, install by URL
- [ ] Plugin version pinning — store which version of a plugin file was imported
- [ ] Plugin update notifications — check plugin repoUrl for newer releases
- [ ] Plugin sandboxing — run untrusted plugins in a worker process, not main process
- [ ] `yt-dlp` as non-disableable anchor (guard in `setPluginEnabled` IPC handler)

### Downloaders / new plugins
- [ ] `N_m3u8DL-RE` plugin — DASH/HLS stream downloader (live streams)
- [ ] `FFmpeg` plugin — direct media conversion/remux without downloading
- [ ] `wget` / `aria2c` plugin — direct URL file download (no metadata extraction)
- [ ] `Cobalt` plugin — cobalt.tools API wrapper (Twitter, TikTok, YouTube Shorts)
- [ ] `PixelDrain` / `GoFile` plugin — file hosting sites
- [ ] Batch input — paste newline-separated URLs, each queued with correct plugin

### Download Queue
- [ ] Concurrency limiter — honor `config.maxConcurrent` (currently ignored)
- [ ] Retry failed downloads
- [ ] Download history persistence — survive app restarts (`config.json` or SQLite)
- [ ] Sort/filter queue (by status, plugin, date)
- [ ] Open downloaded file directly (not just folder)
- [ ] Per-item "change destination folder" before starting

### Settings
- [ ] Load `disabledPlugins` from config on app mount (currently not loaded into React state)
- [ ] Save global settings via IPC instead of alert() success message
- [ ] Binary auto-detect button — runs `which yt-dlp` etc. and fills path fields
- [ ] Auto-update yt-dlp: `yt-dlp -U`

### UI / UX
- [ ] Drag-and-drop URL onto window
- [ ] macOS dock badge with active download count
- [ ] System tray (Windows/Linux) — minimize to tray
- [ ] Notification on download complete (OS native)
- [ ] Light/dark mode toggle (follow OS preference)
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts: `Cmd+V` focus URL bar, `Enter` analyze, `Cmd+D` download
- [ ] Responsive layout — sidebar collapses to icons on narrow window
- [ ] Progress ring instead of bar for audio-only downloads (indeterminate)

## 🏗️ Infrastructure

- [ ] Add test script to `package.json` (`vitest` or `jest`)
- [ ] ESLint config (currently none)
- [ ] `package.json` description update (still says "yt-dlp GUI")
- [ ] `package.json` author field (`albertolicea00`)
- [ ] Move inline styles in App.jsx to CSS classes (currently ~80% inline)
- [ ] Error boundary component in React (uncaught render errors crash whole UI)

### 🚀 GitHub Actions — CI/CD & Releases

- [ ] **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** — runs on every PR:
  - Checkout, setup Node 20 + pnpm
  - `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
  - `pnpm build` (Vite bundle, no Electron packaging)
  - Fail PR if build errors

- [ ] **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** — runs on `push tag v*.*.*`:
  - Matrix: `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, `macos-latest`
  - Checkout + setup Node 20 + pnpm
  - `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
  - `pnpm build` (Vite)
  - macOS: `pnpm package:mac` → upload `dist-package/*.dmg` + `dist-package/*.zip`
  - Windows: `pnpm package:win` → upload `dist-package/*.exe` + `dist-package/*.zip`
  - Linux: `pnpm package:linux` → upload `dist-package/*.AppImage` + `dist-package/*.deb`
  - Create GitHub Release from tag, attach all artifacts
  - Secrets needed: `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID` (for macOS notarization), `GH_TOKEN`

- [ ] **macOS code signing** — `electron-builder` needs `CSC_LINK` (p12 cert base64) + `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` in repo secrets
- [ ] **macOS notarization** — add `afterSign` hook or `notarize` package; requires Apple Developer account
- [ ] **Windows code signing** — `WIN_CSC_LINK` + `WIN_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` in repo secrets (optional but kills SmartScreen warning)
- [ ] **Auto-updater** — add `electron-updater`, configure `publish` in `electron-builder` config pointing to GitHub releases
- [ ] **Homebrew cask** — after first release, submit PR to `homebrew/homebrew-cask` or maintain personal tap `albertolicea00/homebrew-xtractforge`
- [ ] **winget manifest** — submit to `microsoft/winget-pkgs` after first release
- [ ] **Snap / AUR** — `snapcraft.yaml` for Snap Store; `PKGBUILD` for AUR submission
